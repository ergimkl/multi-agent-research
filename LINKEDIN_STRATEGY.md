### **Post 1: The Launch (Day 1)**

**Hook:** The "Built by AI" angle

```
I gave AI a single prompt:

"Build a multi-agent research system"

Here's what I got:

→ 4 specialized AI agents
→ Real-time collaboration 
→ Production-ready code
→ Beautiful UI
→ Fully functional in <1 hour

The future of software development is here.

🧵 Thread on how it works:
```

**Content:**
- Screen recording of the system in action
- Show agents working together
- Highlight the final report quality
- Include the live demo link

**Why it works:**
- Controversial angle (AI building AI)
- Visual proof
- Tangible output
- Easy to understand

---

### **Post 2: Technical Deep-Dive (Day 3-5)**

**Hook:** How the architecture works

```
My AI research system uses 4 specialized agents:

Each agent has a specific role in the research pipeline.

Here's the architecture 👇

1️⃣ Researcher Agent
- Searches multiple sources
- Gathers raw information
- Uses Brave Search API
- Extracts key facts

2️⃣ Fact-Checker Agent  
- Verifies credibility
- Cross-references claims
- Identifies inconsistencies
- Uses Claude AI for verification

3️⃣ Synthesizer Agent
- Combines insights
- Identifies patterns
- Creates coherent narrative
- AI-powered synthesis

4️⃣ Critic Agent
- Evaluates quality
- Scores completeness
- Provides recommendations
- Final approval/rejection

The agents communicate through a message-passing system.

Each agent enriches the data before passing to the next.

Tech stack:
→ Next.js 14
→ TypeScript
→ Brave Search API
→ Claude Sonnet 4
→ Real-time orchestration

### **Post 3: Real vs Mock Comparison (Day 7)**

**Hook:** Show the power of real APIs

```
I tested my multi-agent research system:

Version 1: Mock data
Version 2: Real APIs (Brave Search + Claude)

The difference is SHOCKING 🔥

[Side-by-side comparison]

Mock Version:
✅ Shows concept
✅ Demonstrates flow
❌ Generic insights
❌ No real sources

Real API Version:
✅ Actual web search
✅ Real sources & URLs
✅ AI-powered analysis
✅ Actionable insights
✅ Production-ready

Cost to run:
→ ~$0.50 per research report
→ Brave: $0.02 per search
→ Claude: $0.30-0.50 per report

Worth it for:
→ Research
→ Content creation
→ Due diligence
→ Competitive analysis

- Side-by-side screenshots
- Highlighted differences
- Cost breakdown
- Use case examples

### **Post 4: Use Case Showcase (Day 10)**

**Hook:** Real-world applications

```
I used my AI research system to analyze:

1️⃣ "Future of Multi-Agent AI"
2️⃣ "Best practices for RAG systems"
3️⃣ "Web3 gaming trends"

Each report took < 30 seconds.

Here's what I learned 🧵

[Results screenshots]

The system:
→ Searched 50+ sources
→ Verified credibility
→ Synthesized insights
→ Evaluated quality

Traditional research: 2-3 hours
AI Research System: 30 seconds

Real use cases:
→ Market research
→ Competitive analysis
→ Technical documentation
→ Investment due diligence
→ Content ideation

Most impressive part?
The agents debate and critique each other.

Quality control is built-in.

What topics should I research next?

### **Post 5: Behind the Scenes (Day 14)**

**Hook:** Show the code/building process

```
Building a multi-agent system taught me:

1. Agent communication is hard
2. Error handling is critical  
3. Mock data ≠ Real data
4. UI matters for demos

Here's what I learned 🧵

[Code snippets]

Key challenges:

1️⃣ Agent Coordination
- Sequential vs parallel?
- How to pass data?
- Error recovery?

Solution: Message-passing with orchestrator

2️⃣ API Integration
- Rate limits
- Error handling
- Fallback strategies

Solution: Graceful degradation to mock data

3️⃣ Real-time Updates
- Agent status
- Message flow
- Progress tracking

Solution: State management with React hooks

4️⃣ Production Readiness
- TypeScript for safety
- Proper error boundaries
- API key security
